Say "The Fibonacci Sequence"

The king was nothing,
The queen was everything,
The Jack was mysterious,
My card was a mad-hatter.

Build the king up!

While my card ain't nothing,
Let Jack be the king with the queen
Let the king be the queen,
Let the queen be Jack,
Knock my card down,
Shout the king!
